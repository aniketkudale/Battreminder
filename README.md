# BattReminder

Reminds you when your laptop battery is fully charged!

Most of us work on laptops, and sometimes we end up overcharging it (and honestly wasting some electricity). There's by default a reminder, for almost all laptops, which lets you know when the battery is low. But, how to know when the battery is fully charged? 

This light-weight minimal browser extension will let you know the battery level and will remind you with a sound notification when the battery is fully charged!
